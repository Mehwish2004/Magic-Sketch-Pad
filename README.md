# Magic-Sketch-Pad
This project demonstrates basic Digital Image Processing techniques using Python.
It includes image reading, grayscale conversion, filtering, edge detection, thresholding, and other common DIP operations.

## Features

The project covers commonly used DIP techniques, such as:

- Reading and displaying images

- Converting images to grayscale

- Image resizing and cropping

- Smoothing and blurring filters

- Sharpening filters

- Edge detection (Sobel, Canny, Prewitt, etc.)

- Thresholding (Global, Otsu)

- Morphological operations (Erosion, Dilation, Opening, Closing)

## Files Included

- MagicSketchPad.py – Jupyter notebook containing all DIP implementations

requirements.txt – Required Python libraries

## Technologies Used

Python

OpenCV

NumPy

Matplotlib

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Open and run the notebook:
jupyter notebook

3. Open MagicSketchPad.py and run the cells.
